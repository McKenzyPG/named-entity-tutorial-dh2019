    "**Context** This notebook is meant to drive you through the usage of Corleone and Express, two softwares developed at the Joint Research Center (Europen Commission, Ispra, Italy) by Jakub Piskorski. These softwares are in use in production applications, notably the Europe Media Monitor. They are free for academic usage but you should ask a license if you want to use them beyond this tutorial.\n",

    "**Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Corleone (Core Linguistic Entity Online Extraction) is a set of lightweight linguistic processing components (text scanner, tokenizer, sentence splitter, morphological analysis and gazetteer lookup).\n",
    "- Express (Extraction Pattern Recognition Engine and Specification Suite) is an information extraction grammar engine, which consists of a grammar parser and a grammar interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not manage to do build a full information extraction pipeline within the allocated time (we would need at leat a week!). Here the objective is to **give you an idea** of how things work. We will therefore focus on 2 components: Gazetteers and Grammar, trying to build a small engine to recognize (some) person names.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will rely on an already compiled tokeniser. You will develop a gazetteer, and 2 or 3 rules using relying on it. Let's get started."
