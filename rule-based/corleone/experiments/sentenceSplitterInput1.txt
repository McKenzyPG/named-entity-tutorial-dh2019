The Berlin Wall (German: Berliner Mauer) was erected by the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (East Germany) completely encircling West Berlin, separating it from East Germany, including East Berlin. The longer inner German Border (the IGB) demarcated the border between East and West Germany. Both borders came to symbolize the Iron Curtain between Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc. Prior to the Wall's erection, 3.5 million East Germans had avoided Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions to escape into West Germany, many over the border between East and West Berlin. During its existence from 1961 to 1989, the Wall stopped almost all such emigration and separated East Germany from West Germany for more than a quarter of a century. The Wall included guard towers lining large concrete walls circumscribing a wide area (later known as the "death strip") containing anti-vehicle trenches, "fakir beds" and other defenses. After its erection, around 5,000 people attempted to escape circumventing the wall, with estimates of the resulting death toll varying between 98 and 200.


Me Thomas Gillis, l'avocat de M. Blanc, avait dès lors demandé que la clarté soit faite, étant donné que cette information ne figurait pas au dossier. Le ministère public avait brandi la loi sur les méthodes particulières d'investigation, ce qui a amené la défense à conclure qu'il y avait eu recours à un informateur ou à un agent infiltré. Selon Me Gillis, cette personne serait l'escroc néerlandais A.D.B., ce que le parquet n'a pas voulu confirmer.
