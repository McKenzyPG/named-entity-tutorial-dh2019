As Theresa May’s motorcade swept across the causeway to Osaka airport, where her grey official plane was waiting on the runway in the stifling heat, she passed one more milestone on the humbling journey from No 10 to the backbenches.

This weekend’s G20 was the prime minister’s final major international summit – though she curtly reminded journalists that she still had an EU council and a meeting about the western Balkans to attend before she bows out.

For three more weeks then, she will retain all the trappings of office: the entourage of razor-sharp advisers, the country residence at Chequers, the Downing Street flat. But very soon it will all be gone.

En route to Japan, her aides briefed reporters that she was not yet ready to answer backward-looking questions about her turbulent three-year premiership – let alone anoint a successor, as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt vie to succeed her.

Instead, asked about how she was feeling, she slipped into pure Maybot, saying: “My mood is one of determination to carry on doing the job that I’m doing and to ensure that I get some very strong messages across to those I’m meeting.”

One recipient of such a message was Vladimir Putin. She took the opportunity to rebuke him, face-to-face and at length, over the Skripal poisonings – the pair first posing sternly alongside each other for a photo, May wearing a glower one unkind colleague said looked as though she had practised it in the mirror.
